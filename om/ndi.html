    <h2 class="dropdown-header">About the outcome measure
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Originally published in 1991 in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics, the Neck Disability Index (NDI) is an instrument to measure patient-reported disability secondary to neck pain. It was developed utilizing the Oswestry Low Back Pain Index as a model and therefore, at the time of its creation, was distinguished from other simpler pain assessments by examining patient function with respect to activities of daily living.</p>
        <p>The instrument has 10 items and patients rate their pain from 0 (no pain) to 5 (worst imaginable pain). Individual item responses are summed to a total score, where 0 points indicate no activity limitations and 50 points indicate complete activity limitation. This instrument may be useful in patients with chronic or acute onset neck pain and in patients with musculoskeletal complaints or with cervical radiculopathy.</p>
