# Online Outcome Measures
An online tool allowing for simple and quick completion of orthopedic outcome measures by clinicians or patients. Results can be exported into PDF format. For each outcome measure page, some brief information about the score and its relevant literature is cited.

## PDF Lib
This tool utilises the [pdf-lib](https://pdf-lib.js.org/) library to facilitate the filling out of PDF forms and modifying existing PDF content. After some research, I found this tool to be the most suitable for my use, as many PDF libraries only allow for the creation of PDFs, rather than modification of existing PDFs.

## What makes it different?
Compared to tools like [OrthoToolKit](https://orthotoolkit.com/), Online Outcome Measures opts to modify existing and official outcome measure PDFs, rather than generating a unique form. Therefore the resultant document retains the formatting as intended by the score developer.
